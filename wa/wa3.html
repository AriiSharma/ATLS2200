            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>The Pomeranian is a breed of dog that descended from large sled dogs of the Arctic. It is named after the Pomerania region in Europe. Originally, Pomeranians were much larger, but over time, they were selectively bred to become smaller and more compact.</p>

        <section id="Health">
            <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>Pomeranians are generally healthy dogs, but they can be prone to certain health issues such as dental problems, luxating patella, and tracheal collapse. Regular dental care, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent some of these issues. It's important to work closely with a veterinarian to ensure the overall health of your Pomeranian.</p>
