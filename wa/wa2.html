    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <p>My name is Araju Sharma. I go by She/Her. I am a senior computer science major at CU Boulder. I enjoy painting and spending time outdoors in my free time. In this course, I hope to gain a better understanding of how to code html, css, and js work more efficiently.</p>
